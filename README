Dr. D,

This program reads in a list of 2d points, stores them in a list of vertexs, then stores the vertexs as faces, and prints this all using glVertex3f.  

This program also can rotate the object and move the camera. 

This week we added flat shading by finding the normals of each face and displaying with glnormal3f().  It is important to remember that the vin vector is actually +1 in relation to the vertexes in the vertex_t vector .

We also added 3 lights to our object.
